Accenture Program the Future Challenge

This is simply a boilerplate of the point A.
So we can start where we should be in our development platform.

Objectives (per date) | Note: You can suggest/remove/edit the dates and the objective per date if it doesn't seem to do good.

Before all the objectives, let's all get this into our mindset: think of the possibilities Accenture Singapore is going to do to us,
it won't only boost your portfolio and jumpstart your job entry salary (because of this achievement) but it might help you in
establishing more connections in the field of software engineering. Kudos to us.
